**IOS101-Prework** is an app that change background color after clicking button.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps
1.Instagram(people can post)
2.Maps(people can locate and find a way)
3.Podcasts(people can review multiple casts online)

I want to build an App for people to meditation. It can record the time people have spent.

## Notes

My Xcode version is the latest, so it's a bit different from the instructions, which has caused some difficulties.
